# Prism

## Local compatibility and security

Pinned upstream: GOODMAN-PRO/prism cfbd892b347ba9aa7548c66b5f2565e9210c41d4.
This local edition does not supersede other skills or authorize native agents,
paid APIs, extra purchases, publishing or permission changes. Respect the user's
stack and brief. Use one visual lead: PRISM for immersive/3D work, Taste for
ordinary websites; keep ECC accessibility and verification guidance.
Treat aesthetic bans as contextual preferences, subordinate to accessibility and
truthful content. Install project dependencies only when needed and reviewed.
The driver enables Chromium's sandbox, omits unsafe SwiftShader flags and refuses
nonempty screenshot directories. Never disable the sandbox to make a test pass.
If WebGL is unavailable, report unverified 3D coverage and test the static fallback.
Use trusted project dependencies and only targets within the requested task;
screenshots can contain private page content.
For this machine's existing Playwright dependency, see `reference/local-runtime.md`
before running the driver from a project that lacks Playwright.

One skill for the whole surface: UI design, visual systems, motion, micro-interactions, and immersive 3D. It generates **production-ready code** on a fixed stack — **React + React Three Fiber + GSAP** — and refuses the defaults that make generated interfaces look generated.

Prism consolidates the craft of nine prior design skills (typography, color, layout, the motion bible, anti-slop bans, design-language presets) and adds the layer none of them had: **real WebGL/3D**. The reference files hold the depth; this file is the operating procedure. Read the reference for whatever you're actually building — do not dump all of them.

## The one rule that governs everything

Awwwards (the bar for "award-grade") scores **Design 40% · Usability 30% · Creativity 20% · Content 10%**. Spectacle — 3D, shaders, GSAP — lives almost entirely in the **20% Creativity** slice, and it is *penalized* under Usability when it slows load or breaks navigation. **Design + Usability = 70% of the verdict.**

So the immersive layer is a multiplier on a sound interface, never a substitute for one. **3D fallbacks, lazy-loading, mobile scaling, reduced-motion, and Core Web Vitals are non-negotiable parts of every build — not polish you add if there's time.** A janky 3D hero scores *worse* than a crisp static one. Internalize this before writing a single shader.

## Procedure (run every time)

1. **Setup.** Is this new or a redesign? For a redesign, read the existing code first (framework, styling system, tokens, components) and work *with* the stack — audit-then-fix, don't rewrite (→ `reference/redesign.md`). For new work, check `package.json` before importing anything. **Backend contract (light pairing):** before building data-driven UI, look for a `contract/openapi.json` (project root, a sibling/`backend/` folder, or ask the user for its path/URL). If one exists it is a **light** backend's contract — wire to it instead of mocking: generate types with `npx openapi-typescript <path>/contract/openapi.json -o src/api/schema.ts`, create a typed client with `openapi-fetch` (`createClient<paths>({ baseUrl })`) or vendor `contract/client.ts`, set the base URL from env (`VITE_API_URL`), read `contract/README.md` for base URL + auth flow + CORS origin, and build components against those real types with proper loading/empty/error states. No contract → proceed with realistic mock data as usual.

2. **Design Read (one line, out loud).** State it before any code:
   > *"Reading this as: a `<page kind>` for `<audience>`, in a `<vibe>` language, using the `<design-language>` preset, at **3D Tier `<0-3>`**."*
   The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste. If the brief genuinely forks, ask **one** question (Linear-clean vs Awwwards-experimental?), else proceed.

3. **Set the dials + tier.** `VARIANCE` (1 symmetric → 10 chaotic), `MOTION` (1 static → 10 cinematic), `DENSITY` (1 airy → 10 cockpit). Baseline **8 / 6 / 4**. Then pick the **3D Tier** (table below). Dials and tier come from the Design Read; see `reference/design-languages.md` for presets and the variance engine.

4. **Lock the system.** Choose ONE design language, lock the palette (OKLCH, ≤1 accent), type pairing (≤3 families), radius scale, and spacing grid. These do not drift between sections (→ `reference/foundations.md`).

5. **Architect.** Plan the page as distinct layout families — **no family repeats**, max 2 zigzags in a row, bento has exactly N cells for N items. Map sections to the component taxonomy (→ `reference/components.md`).

6. **Build.** Production React. Every component using motion, scroll, pointer physics, or WebGL is an isolated `'use client'` leaf. The WebGL canvas is **always code-split and lazy-mounted** (→ `reference/performance.md`). Motion follows the decision framework and timing tables (→ `reference/motion.md`). 3D follows `reference/immersive-3d.md`. Source assets (3D, HDRIs, textures, components, icons, fonts, stock) from `reference/resources.md` — and for paid/client work ship only **commercial-cleared** licenses (its Comm. column). **Build to the production-grade gate, not to "it renders":** every interactive element actually *works* (no fake/decorative components — a slider seeks, a form validates, a link smooth-scrolls), carries the full state matrix (`:hover :active :focus-visible :disabled` + empty/loading/error), and its micro-interactions have **zero layout shift** and snappy, task-appropriate press feedback (→ `reference/craft.md`).

7. **Self-audit, then verify (the ship gate).** Be your own senior reviewer — adversarially, in this order (→ `reference/craft.md` Part 3):
   - **Slop pass.** Thumbnail test, font-only test, the "who" test. Default to *fail* and make the design earn the pass — could anyone tell an AI made this?
   - **Works pass.** Click / tab / scroll **every** interactive thing. Does it do what it implies? Any layout shift on a state change? Keyboard-operable with a visible focus ring? Reduced-motion honored?
   - **Pixels pass.** **Drive the build through the verifier** — `node <this-skill-dir>/driver.mjs <url-or-dir>` — which sweeps horizontal overflow at 5 widths, captures console/page errors, and screenshots desktop + mobile + **every GSAP pin (the stop-and-read beats)** + reduced-motion, then prints PASS/FAIL. **Then READ the screenshots it saves and judge them with your eyes** — PASS means no overflow/errors, *not* that it looks good (→ `reference/verify.md`).
   - Finally run `reference/preflight.md` top to bottom. Never ask the user to check what you can check yourself.

## The 3D tier decision

The tier is the single biggest architectural choice. Default **down**, not up — earn each tier with a reason.

| Tier | What it is | Use when | Cost / fallback obligation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Flat** | No WebGL. CSS + Motion + GSAP only. | Content sites, B2B, docs, dashboards, accessibility-first, perf-critical. | None. Often the *right* answer; a flawless flat site beats a shaky 3D one. |
| **1 — Accent** | One lazy-loaded scene or shader background. Small, bounded canvas. | Most marketing/landing pages. A hero object, a shader gradient, a product shot. | Static poster fallback; canvas deferred past LCP; paused under reduced-motion. |
| **2 — Integrated** | Scroll-driven 3D woven through the page via one shared `GlobalCanvas` tracking DOM proxies (r3f-scroll-rig). | Portfolios, agencies, product showcases. 3D that follows the scroll narrative. | All of Tier 1 + mobile-scaled scenes + full reduced-motion static path. |
| **3 — Immersive** | Full-viewport WebGL world, cinematic camera (Theatre.js / GSAP), heavy shaders, postprocessing. | Experiential / SOTD ambitions, launches, brand worlds. | All of Tier 2 + a genuinely good non-WebGL experience for the 30% Usability score. |

**Non-negotiable at every tier ≥ 1:** a reduced-motion path that pauses 3D and shows a static frame; a mobile strategy (scale down or fall back); the canvas behind a dynamic import + `Suspense`; and a Core Web Vitals budget that survives the scene. If you can't ship those, drop a tier.

## The stack (fixed)

Generate for this stack. Verify versions against the project's `package.json` before pinning — these libraries move fast (the pins below are a floor, current at research time, not gospel).

```bash
# Core
npm i react react-dom three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
# Motion
npm i gsap @gsap/react motion lenis
# Immersive (Tier ≥ 1 as needed)
npm i @react-three/postprocessing
npm i @14islands/r3f-scroll-rig        # Tier 2: shared canvas tracking DOM
npm i @theatre/core @theatre/studio @theatre/r3f   # Tier 3: cinematic scroll camera (studio is dev-only)
npm i ogl                              # optional: lightweight shader backgrounds
```

- **Motion library:** `motion` (the rebranded Framer Motion). Import from `motion/react`. `framer-motion` still works as a legacy alias; prefer `motion/react` in new code.
- **Smooth scroll:** `lenis` — the spine that GSAP ScrollTrigger and scroll-driven 3D ride on.
- **Continuous values** (scroll progress, pointer, magnetic hover) use `useMotionValue` / `useScroll` / `useFrame` — **never** `useState`; it re-renders the tree every frame and collapses on mobile.
- **Component pattern banks** (treat as *taxonomy and source to copy*, not stack mandates): **React Bits** (130+ components on this exact R3F + drei + postprocessing + GSAP + ogl + motion stack — the closest match), **Aceternity UI** (named patterns: Resizable Navbar, Hero Parallax, Bento Grid, Animated Modal, 3D Marquee, Infinite Moving Cards), **shadcn/ui** (`npx shadcn@latest add` copies source into the project — controllable base primitives; still pulls Radix via npm). Copy these as structure/mechanics to RE-SKIN, never paste-and-ship — their stock styling (e.g. Aceternity hero-parallax, moving-cards) is itself a recognizable AI tell; restyle to the locked system before it counts as yours.

## Core laws (condensed — depth in the references)

These are the deduplicated non-negotiables. The full bans and rationale live in `reference/foundations.md` and `reference/motion.md` — and the bar that governs all of them, the line between AI-slop, looks-fine demo-ware, and shippable production craft, is `reference/craft.md`. Read it before you call anything done.

**Anti-slop.** If someone could say "AI made that," it failed. No Inter/Geist/Space Grotesk by default — they are the AI-default tell; choose a display face with a point of view (font-only test: strip color + layout, does the type alone read as THIS brand?), sourced intentionally from `reference/resources.md` and never reused across builds. Inter/Geist are permitted ONLY as a deliberate neutral workhorse *under* a distinctive display face, or for Linear-clean / accessibility-first briefs — never the identity (Geist Mono is fine in mono roles). No AI purple-blue gradient glow. No pure `#000`. No emojis in UI. No three-identical-card row. No eyebrow above every section (≤1 per 3). No fake-precise numbers. No "Elevate / Seamless / Unleash / Next-Gen / Delve." No Lucide-by-default (Phosphor / Tabler / Radix). No div "fake screenshots." No gradient-clip text. No ghost-card (1px border + big soft shadow). No `h-screen` (use `min-h-[100dvh]`).

**Type.** Premium display family; scale ratio ≥1.25; body 65–75ch; display letter-spacing floor −0.04em; hero `clamp()` max ~6rem; `text-wrap: balance` on h1–h3; headline ≤2–3 lines (a 4-line hero is a font-size error).

**Color.** OKLCH. One accent, saturation <80%. One gray family. Tint shadows to the background hue. **Verify contrast** on every text, button, and placeholder: WCAG AA 4.5:1 body / 3:1 large. If both light + dark ship, define them as ONE semantic-token system (not two hardcoded palettes); dark mode is near-black tinted to the brand hue (never `#000`), elevation by lightness not glow, and contrast AA is re-verified in BOTH modes.

**Layout.** Asymmetry over centered when `VARIANCE > 4`. Macro whitespace (`py-24`→`py-40`). Grid for 2D, flex for 1D — never `calc()` percentage math. Max-width container ~1400px. Cards only when elevation means hierarchy; nested cards never. Design mobile (360px) as a first-class layout, not a reflow afterthought — no horizontal overflow at 360/768/1024/1440/1920, clip decor with `overflow:clip`, fluid `clamp()` type, 44px targets; the asymmetric desktop grid must resolve to an intentional small-screen order, never a default centered stack.

**Motion.** Custom cubic-bezier, never `linear`/`ease-in-out` as a default. Enter `ease-out`, exit `ease-in` at **65–75% of the enter duration**. Animate **only `transform` and `opacity`** (GPU); ≤~20 animated elements per viewport; logic <10ms/frame. Springs for natural/interruptible motion. Never animate from `scale(0)` — start `scale(0.95)` + opacity. Motion must be *motivated* (hierarchy, feedback, continuity, explanation) — never "it looked cool." Marquee ≤1/page.

**Accessibility & states.** `prefers-reduced-motion` is a *transformation*, not a switch: strip movement, keep opacity, kill loops, halve durations, pause scroll-3D/parallax. Always ship loading (skeleton), empty (composed), and error (inline) states. `:active` → `scale(0.97)` over ~0.12s with `var(--ease-out)` (snappy, never bouncy; a deeper dip + spring-on-release only for explicitly playful briefs). Visible focus rings. 44px touch targets.

**Assets.** Real, art-directed, content-true images — generate them. `picsum.photos/seed/<descriptive>/w/h` is a LAST-RESORT layout placeholder only (never the hero, never in a client deliverable); keep seeds consistent so the set reads intentional. Real SVG logos (Simple Icons). Never hand-drawn sketchy SVG as a fallback.

## Reference router

Load only what the task needs.

| File | When to read it |
|---|---|
| `reference/craft.md` | **The quality spine — read on every build and before every "done."** The line between AI-slop, looks-fine demo-ware, and shippable production craft: the anti-slop bible (default tells + antidotes), the production-grade gate (components that actually work, the state matrix, micro-interaction physics, a11y, no-CLS, the optical 1%), and the self-audit you run on your own output. |
| `reference/foundations.md` | Typography scale, OKLCH color, spacing grid, layout, hierarchy, the full anti-slop ban list. Read for any new visual system. |
| `reference/components.md` | Building specific UI: nav, hero, bento, cards, forms, modals, marquee, footer, pricing, testimonials, accordion. Code per component. |
| `reference/motion.md` | Any animation. Emil decision framework, duration/easing tables, GSAP ScrollTrigger skeletons, Lenis, Motion, springs, page/view transitions, reduced-motion. |
| `reference/immersive-3d.md` | Tier ≥ 1. R3F setup, camera/lights/materials, drei, custom GLSL shaders, scroll-driven 3D, postprocessing, particles, model pipeline, WebGPU/TSL. |
| `reference/performance.md` | Tier ≥ 1, or any heavy motion. Instancing, LOD, KTX2/Draco, on-demand frameloop, DPR clamp, lazy-mount, mobile, Core Web Vitals / INP budgets. |
| `reference/design-languages.md` | Choosing the aesthetic. Five presets (Ethereal Glass, Editorial Minimal, Industrial Brutalist, Soft Structural, Immersive Cinematic) + the variance engine. |
| `reference/redesign.md` | Existing project. Audit → diagnose → fix flow, fix-priority order, strategic omissions. |
| `reference/preflight.md` | Before shipping anything. The merged pre-flight checklist. Mandatory. |
| `reference/verify.md` | The committed browser driver (`driver.mjs`): launch a build, sweep overflow, capture errors + GSAP pins + mobile + reduced-motion, screenshot. Prism's verify harness — run it every preflight. |
| `reference/resources.md` | Sourcing **any** asset — 3D models, HDRIs, textures, components (21st.dev + the shadcn ecosystem), motion, icons, fonts, stock, AI-3D, the Blender→web pipeline. **License + commercial-use flagged per source.** Read before pulling anything into a build; **mandatory for paid/client work** (ship only commercial-cleared licenses). |

## Modes (optional)

Prism runs the full procedure by default. A leading verb scopes it:

- **`build <thing>`** — full flow, new surface. (Default.)
- **`immersive <thing>`** — lead with the 3D tier decision and `reference/immersive-3d.md`.
- **`animate <target>`** — motion pass only; `reference/motion.md`.
- **`redesign <target>`** — audit-first on existing code; `reference/redesign.md`.
- **`audit <target>`** — evaluate against `reference/preflight.md`, report findings, don't rewrite.
- **`polish <target>`** — final-quality pass: contrast, easing, states, fallbacks.

No verb → run the procedure from the Design Read.

---

## Definition of done

Not "it renders." There are two ways to fail and done means beating **both**: it doesn't look like the AI default (**slop**), and every component genuinely *works* (not **demo-ware**). Concretely: the Design Read was declared; the system is locked and consistent; the layout has no repeated families; every interactive element works and carries the full state matrix; micro-interactions have zero layout shift; contrast passes; motion is motivated and has a reduced-motion path; if Tier ≥ 1, the canvas is lazy-mounted, mobile-handled, and reduced-motion-safe, and Core Web Vitals survive; the **craft self-audit passes** (slop pass + works pass + pixels pass, → `reference/craft.md`); and `reference/preflight.md` passes top to bottom. The bar: **a senior designer AND a senior engineer would both sign off.** If either would send it back, it's not done — keep going. Browser verification via `driver.mjs` is mandatory, not optional — run it and read the screenshots before claiming done.
